I used the [Jungle Color Palette](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/84872) from the website color-hex made by [Chad_torino](https://www.color-hex.com/member/chad_torino) and the color red (#ff0000).

- I've used #e9ed60 & #422f25 as the primary and secondary colors for the site's text.

- I've used #422f25 as the overlay on the site's background image.

- I've used #e9ed60 & #be945b for borders on buttons, questions, answers, and the quiz area.

- I've used #52843c to show buttons.

- I've used #e9ed60 for button hover effects.

- I've used #ff0000 to indicate wrong answers.

- I've used #e9ed60 to highlight the correct answer.


![J U N G L E Color Palette](/doc/readme-images/color-palette.png)

### Typography

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

I chose the [Lemon Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lemon?query=lemon&sort=alpha) for the site's font because it's a personal preference of mine. I find that the font has a visually appealing appearance that I personally enjoy. Additionally, it's easy to read, which is important for a quiz-style website where users need to quickly comprehend the text.

Furthermore, I believe that the Lemon font fits perfectly with the style and aesthetic of the quiz. Its clean and modern look adds a touch of sophistication while still maintaining a playful vibe, which aligns well with the overall theme of the quiz. Overall, I selected the Lemon Google Fonts because I found it aesthetically pleasing, easy to read, and fitting for the style and tone of the quiz.

Sans Serif is used as a backup font, in case for any reason the [Lemon](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lemon?query=lemon&sort=alpha) font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

![Lemon](doc/readme-images/Lemon.png)

### Imagery

I chose a jungle background for the website because of its thematic relevance to the website's title, 'Jungle Quiz.'

By incorporating an image of a jungle as the page background, I aimed to immerse the user in the atmosphere of a jungle environment, creating an engaging and immersive experience. 

This choice is intended to evoke the sense of adventure and exploration that one might associate with a jungle setting, enhancing the overall theme and appeal of the Jungle Quiz website. 

Ultimately, the jungle background serves to enhance the user's participation in the quiz, making them feel as though they are embarking on a thrilling journey through the heart of the jungle.

Bugs
----

### Solved Bugs

- When testing the JavaScript code for the first time, [JSHint Validator](https://jshint.com/) returned a few crucial errors because semicolons were missing in a couple of lines.

After fixing all the errors, JSHint returned 23 warnings regarding ES6. 

For example, 'const' is available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6') or Mozilla JS extensions (use 'moz').

At this juncture, I lack the knowledge on how to resolve this issue/warnings.

- I implemented an onclick() event in the buttons on the index.html page, resolving it by using the getElementById method.

- At first, I created two separate files for questions and styles. This resulted in an undefined question warning when validating. My mentor recommended combining these two files into one for better practice.

- In the media query for small and medium screens (min-width: 769px - max-width: 1024px), the correct answer effect was presented on top of the other questions. I fixed that by adding:

.answerbutton {
    margin: 15px 0;
}

- For the same screens, the height was mistakenly set to 7000px. I changed it to 700px.

#question_area_box {
    max-width: 750px;
    height: 700px;
    margin: 40px auto 0;
}


### Known Bugs

- For an unknown reason, a random answer is being highlighted in yellow before the user even selects an answer. This bug must be resolved so iPhone users can enjoy the quiz too.
